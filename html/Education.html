                        <p><span class="Subtitle">Riverton Highschool 2020-2023</span><br>
                             I graduated from Riverton Highschool in 2023 with an enhanced diploma in Business and Marketing, Math, and social studies.
                             I also completed a CTE pathway and was recognised for my participation in many school activities.
                             I participated in various clubs like FBLA, DECA, National Honor Society, and Math club.
                             While a student I learned much more than just academic diciplines; I also learned who to show up on time and work in teams, and make friends quickly in new environments.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="Subtitle"> Brigham Young University 2023-Present</span><br>
                            I started at BYU the fall after I graduated from highschool as sophomore, this is because I took many AP and concurrent classes while in highschool.
                            Now I'm just about a junior and ready to apply to the Mariot school of Business.
                            I'm hoping to get into the strategic management program, so cross your fingers and maybe I'll get in.
                            So far BYU has been a great experience for me and I've learned so much in my classes and in my regular life as I'm living away from home for the first time.
                        </p>
                        <P><span class="Subtitle"> Future Plans</span><br>
                            As I progress into my future I'm filled with excitement and just a little bit of anxiety, but I'm confident in myself and God's plan for me.
                            After graduating with a batchlor's degree from the school of business I'm to hoping continue my education and earn my MBA.
                            I'm also hoping to get as much hands on experience as I can through early jobs and through internships that will allow me to enter the workforce early and with experience as well as a top quality education.
