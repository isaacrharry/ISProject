                            <br>Eagle Scout<br>
                            I spent a few years in the scouting program and earned the rank of eagle scout. 
                            I learned a lot of survival skills but I think the most useful skill that I learned was first aid.
                            I took the merit badge many times and I now feel confident that I know what action to take in most medical emergency situations until the first responders arrive.<br>
                            <br>DECA<br>
                            In highschool I won state competitions all three years and went on to the national competitions.
                            Two of the times it was because of my business projects and the third was because of my ability to roleplay as an consultant so well.
                            These experiences gave me plenty of practice marketing, selling, and strategizing.
                            While not official schooling these practices have given me more applicable skills for the real world than many of school classes I've taken.<br>
                            <br>NHS VP<br>
                            As the vice president of the national honors society at my highschool I organized many activities with sixty or more students in attendance.
                            I managed the funds for the club and learned so much about putting together events and managing accounts for an organization. <br>
                            <br>Mr. Silverrush Pageant<br>
                            My senior year of highschool I had the opportunity to be the host in our Mr. Silverrush Pageant. 
                            I helped to produce the script but most of all I spent an hour and a half entertaining a crowd of several hundred.
                            I learned a lot about how to present well and most of all I overcame my fear of being in front of a large crowds of people.<br>
